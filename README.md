# Moral Anger and Disgust: Recipient vs. Initiator Focus in Moral Transgressions

## Description
In this study, we examined which of the condemning moral emotion (anger or disgust) is likely to occur first following a situation of moral transgression. 

In line with the appraisal tendency framework, we aimed to determine whether primary emotions are associated with moral violations of autonomy, depending on contextual information about the victim or the perpetrator. The objective of our experimental task was to judge whether or not a witnessâ€™ emotional reaction following a moral transgression is (not)expected to occur, relative to the situation.
